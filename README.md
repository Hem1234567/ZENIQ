# ZENIQ — Update 5 (this version)

* **New name and logo.** The app is now **ZENIQ** everywhere (name, notifications, files, prompts) with the new launcher icon
  (adaptive, round, themed/monochrome) and a matching notification icon. The internal package id is unchanged so an installed
  copy updates in place.
* **No more Allow / Deny pop-up.** ZENIQ does what you ask on your own phone straight away, and it no longer answers with
  "I can't do that for security reasons".
* **`browser_script` tool.** The model writes a small JSON step list (`open`, `wait`, `type`, `click`, `press`, `scroll`,
  `extract`, `eval`, `show`) and the phone runs all of it in one go in the built-in browser; the final page is then opened in
  your own browser. "Open YouTube and search free fire" is also handled instantly without waiting for the model.
* **Images and video.** Say "generate one apple image" or "make a short clip for a thank-you screen" in the chat. Images use the free
  Pollinations service (no key) or any OpenRouter image model; videos use OpenRouter video models (key + credits).
  The new *Cloud models* section on the Models page lists paid GPT / chat models, image, video and any-to-any models and lets you pick one.
* **Cooler and faster.** The local model now uses only the fast CPU cores, the tool prompt is much shorter and only describes the tools
  the request needs, the start of the chat prompt is pre-loaded right after the model loads, and the streamed text updates the screen
  less often. Cloud (Fast Mode) answers start in about a second or two.
* **PowerPoint templates without stock photos.** All sample photos are removed from the six templates.

# ZENIQ — Update 4 (this version)

**Designed files.** Every PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and text file now comes out with a real design instead of plain text.

* **PowerPoint** is filled into the bundled templates in `app/src/main/assets/templates/ppt/`
  (3 normal ones, 3 premium ones). Ask for a *premium / beautiful / professional* presentation and a premium template is
  used; ask for just a "ppt" and a normal one is used. The app remembers the last template and picks a different one next time.
  The engine clones the template slide that fits the content (cards, list, text), swaps the text, shrinks fonts to fit and
  drops the slides it does not need. If a template ever fails, the built-in plain layout is used, so a file is always made.
* **Word / PDF / Excel / text** use 6 colour themes (3 normal, 3 premium) with a title banner, themed headings, tables,
  header/footer and page numbers. Same rule: premium words choose a premium theme, and the theme rotates.
* **Bug fixed:** attaching a file and writing "summarize this" now summarizes the *new file*. Its text is placed inside the
  message itself and the earlier chat is hidden from the model for that turn.

Adding or changing a template: put the `.pptx` in the folder and run `tools/templates/prep.py`
(it trims unused slides, compresses pictures and regenerates `TemplateCatalog.kt`).

# ZENIQ

On-device AI agent for Android (llama.cpp + Qwen3) with an Apple-style UI.

## Update 3 (this version)
- **Code answers like Claude**: code always appears in a dark/light *code block* with syntax colours (keywords, strings, numbers, comments, functions, tags) and a **Copy** button. Normal answers render markdown (bold, lists, headings, tables) and also have a **Copy** button.
- **No web search for code**: if you ask for code (or to fix/explain code) ZENIQ skips every tool, so it never opens the browser or searches the web. The model writes the code itself (your local model, or the cloud model when Fast Mode is on). Code requests automatically get a larger answer budget and a lower temperature for accuracy.
- **Build a small app -> ZIP**: say *"build a small todo app"* / *"make a snake game"* / *"create a calculator website"*. ZENIQ writes the files, packs them into a ZIP and shows a card with **Download ZIP** and **Share**.
  Every ZIP is saved on the phone in one dedicated folder: `Documents/ZENIQApps/<project>.zip` (Files app -> Documents -> ZENIQApps). Web apps (index.html + css + js) run by simply opening `index.html`.
- **Apple-style attach menu**: the **+** button opens an iOS action sheet (Camera / Photos / Files) with coloured icon tiles and a Cancel button.

On-device AI agent (llama.cpp + Qwen3), Apple-style UI, live process cards, phone control, in-app browser.

## Get the APK from GitHub (no Android Studio needed)
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload **the contents of this folder** (so `.github/`, `app/`, `build.gradle.kts` sit at the repo root).
   Using git:  `git init && git add . && git commit -m "ZENIQ" && git branch -M main && git remote add origin <your-repo-url> && git push -u origin main`
2. Open the **Actions** tab -> **Build ZENIQ APK** runs automatically (first build ~10-15 min).
3. Open the finished run -> **Artifacts** -> download **ZENIQ-APK-<run number>** -> unzip -> install `ZENIQ.apk`
   (allow "Install unknown apps").
4. Optional permanent download link: tag a release:  `git tag v0.1 && git push --tags`
   -> the APK appears under the repo's **Releases** page.

## First run
- The app reads your phone's RAM and suggests the best Qwen3 model; tap **Download**. It loads automatically.
- Settings -> enable the ZENIQ accessibility service (Android 13+: App info -> ⋮ -> Allow restricted settings).
- Optional: Settings -> Display over other apps.

## Build locally
Android Studio + NDK 26.1 + CMake 3.22.1, run `./setup.sh` once, press Run on an arm64 phone.
# ZENIQ-04



## What's new
- **Faster replies**: no-think mode for local Qwen3, tools only sent when the request needs them, instant "take a photo" path.
- **Fast Mode button** in the chat header (and in Settings). Live list of free OpenRouter models, automatic fallback if one is unavailable.
- **File attach like Claude**: the PDF shows above the prompt box and only enters the chat when you send. Real PDF text extraction (PdfBox).
- **Camera**: `take_photo` opens the camera and presses the shutter via the accessibility service.

## Update 2
- **Voice is OFF by default**; turn it on with the speaker button in chat or Settings > Voice (remembered).
- **Attach menu (+)**: Camera, Photos, Files. Images are read by a free cloud vision model (needs Fast Mode).
- **Left sidebar** (menu button or swipe right): New chat, recent chats, Show more -> full History screen with search and delete. Chats are saved and get an automatic title.
- **Settings > Storage & memory**: live app storage (models, chats, cache, APK) and live RAM use, plus Clear cache.
- **More phone tools**: web_search, youtube_search, maps_search, send_sms, call_number, set_alarm, set_timer, screenshot; the agent keeps going until the task is done. "Always allow" in the approval dialog removes repeated prompts.

## Update 3 — Documents: create, download and edit PDF / Word / Excel / PowerPoint
- **Ask for a file and get a real one.** "Create a PDF resume", "make an Excel budget with formulas", "Word report on solar energy", "PowerPoint on AI, 8 slides", or several at once ("PDF and Word and Excel"). The chat shows a card with **Open**, **Download** and **Share**.
- **Where files go:** every file is saved to `Documents/ZENIQFiles/` on the phone. **Download** puts another copy in `Downloads/ZENIQ/`. Open uses any PDF/Office viewer on the phone; Share opens the Android share sheet.
- **Upload and edit.** Attach (+ → Files) a `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.csv`, `.txt` or `.md`, then say what to change ("fix the grammar", "add a Tax column", "translate to Hindi", "make slide 3 shorter"). ZENIQ writes a new `<name>-edited.<ext>` in the same format and keeps your original untouched.
- **Follow-up edits.** A file ZENIQ just created stays editable: "change the title", "add a conclusion", "now give me this as a PDF".
- **Convert without AI.** "Convert this PDF to Word", "save it as Excel/PDF/PPTX" is done instantly on the phone: no model, no internet, nothing rewritten.
- **Excel details:** one sheet per table, styled header, frozen top row, filters, number / % / currency formats, and formulas (`=SUM(B2:B6)`) that also store their computed result, so they show correctly even in phone previews.
- Old binary formats (`.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`) can't be read: save them as `.docx` / `.xlsx` / `.pptx` first.
- **Limits:** editing rewrites the whole document, so very long files need Fast Mode (about 18,000 characters) or a larger local context. Layout of an *uploaded* file (fonts, images, custom styles) is rebuilt in ZENIQ's clean style; text, headings, lists, tables and formulas are kept.
- No new libraries were added: Word/Excel/PowerPoint are written directly as Office files and PDFs use Android's built-in PDF engine, so the GitHub build is unchanged.
